          A new version of the Drupal content management system will be released
          on June 3rd, 2020. You will have to migrate to Drupal 9 by November
          2021. If you are now using Drupal 8.x, it will not be a big hassle, as
          it shares the same migration path as Drupal 8.x. However, those who
          have delayed the upgrade to the latest Drupal 7 and 8 versions will
          cause end security updates after this period.

          Good news first: upgrading will be very swift if you are currently up
          to date on Drupal 8 systems. Exactly nothing will change. The complex
          part lies elsewhere for outdated versions.

        <h2>Drupal 8 upgrade easily and without risk</h2>
        <p>
          While the development of many of Drupal's major version upgrades has
          been quite laborious and sometimes risky, requiring a complete rebuild
          from scratch, this time there's no need for heavy lifting if you are
          already up-to-date with the newest version of Drupal 8.x. If you
          haven't, however, you must first switch to the latest minor version.
